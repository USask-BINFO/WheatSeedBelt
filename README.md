# WheatSeedBelt
- - - 

This repository contains an image processing pipeline designed for the manipulation and analysis of images from the WheatSeedBelt Dataset. These images are associated with the research paper titled `Detection of Fusarium Damaged Kernel in Wheat Using Deep Semi-Supervised Learning on a Novel WheatSeedBelt Dataset.`

To extract the RoIs (Regions of Interest) from the original .npy images, you might need to run the following commands: 

```bash 
python3 image_converter.py --config configs/image_converter.yaml
python3 segmentor_pipeline.py --config configs/segmentor.yaml
python3 extractor_pipeline.py --config configs/extractor.yaml
```

Note that before doing each step, you should change the corresponding config 
files to point to the correct directories.

The `image_converter.py` script converts the original .npy images to 
standard .npy images with conventioal internsity values (0-255). This script, 
however, is not necessary if you already have the standard images with 
conventioal internsity values (0-255). 

Note that the `image_converter` script works with directories. So, the right 
pathes to the directories should be provided in the config file.

For the `segmentor_pipline`, you should provide the path to a .csv file that 
includes the pathes to the images with the following columns names: 
`PackageID`, `ImageID`, `Image`, `Label` (see the `data` directory 
provided in the paper for an example)

For the `extractor_pipeline`, you should provide the path to a .csv file 
generated by the `segmentor_pipeline` script.

An overview of the pre-processing pipeline developed for wheat kernel images. 
First, we use a center crop to remove boundary noise or artifacts that may adversely affect segmentation accuracy. This is followed by color
conversion, segmentation, mask cleaning, then the extraction of regions of 
interest and relevant texture-level features recorded as feature vectors.
